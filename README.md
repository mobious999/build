# Windows Operating Building Scripts

This collection of scripts can be used to build and configure Microsoft Windows os types to any specification that is required.

The scripts themselves are parameterized with help examples in the scripts.

## Getting Started

These scripts have all been tested against Windows 2012r2 and windows server 2016.

The collection is based on my current configuration requirements (I.E. Desktop must look this way etc)

### Prerequisites

Windows powershell 5.1 preferred.

```
Each script will be able to do error logging (default) but is not a requirement. 

The option is there as a parameter for debugging if required.

Each script has example files that you all you have to do is type get-help (scriptname) to see examples.

```
### Installing

You can copy to the host to and run the script with whatever parameters are required to complete the task your trying to accompliahs

## Running the tests

As part of the testing psscriptanalyzer was run against each script.

## Deployment

Read through the descriptions all parameters are documented and as to how to run them.
